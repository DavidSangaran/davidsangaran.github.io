    <p>
      I am a former soldier and Military Domain Expert Air Force Engineer who, sparking from a love of programming, have embarked on a journey to seek opportunities for growth in the IT industry.
      With aspirations to cement a career in IT and to develop myself further, I am currently pursuing a degree in Information and Communication Technology.
      My time in the military and aviation industry has allowed me to foster invaluable skills. I have a keen eye for detail from years of spotting defects and I am also very apt at troubleshooting problems, honed from painstakingly back tracing many wiring and schematic diagrams.
      My various other responsibilities in my career have developed me to be a very adaptable person despite being in disparate roles.      
      Furthermore, I enjoy being part of projects. My years in the Military and in my educational institutes have given me the pleasure of being a collaborator in several different problem-solving ideas.
      I can bring a lot to the table in terms of creativity as I can ideate more efficient solutions and processes to achieve a common goal.
